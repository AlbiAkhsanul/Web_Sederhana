                        Shaw is well known for her very good Crowd Control (CC) skill, decent stats and the fact that you can obtain her for free after clearing 
                        a certain level from the main story. Even thought Shaw is only a four star unit, lots of people still use her in high level due to how versatile
                        she is, need a decent pusher? use Shaw, need someone to kill a horde of small enemies? use Shaw, also teh fact that you can put her in both ground
                        and sniper tiles boost her compability even further.

                        Other than her combat compability, our little squirel is also known due to how she rap, yes she talks so fast that it literally sounds like 
                        she is rapping. Shaw is a firefighter, so her personality is somehow based on that, her lines talk about firefighting stuff and her weapons are firefighter
                        tools, like she uses axe in her "basic attacks" and use the firefighter hose in her skills to push enemy away.
